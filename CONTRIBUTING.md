# Contributing to the project

Thanks for considering contributing to our project!

You can contribute in any of the following ways:
* Submitting bugs or feature requests
* Submitting code or docs

## Submitting bugs or feature requests 

In case you have identified a bug or want to introduce a feature request (FR), please go through the next steps:
1. Go to the [Issues tab](../../issues)
2. Check if your bug or FR was already added
    * In case there’s already an entry, review the comments and add something new if you consider it.
    * In case there’s no previous entry, submit your request and fill in the template.

## Submitting code or docs

In case you want to contribute with code (fixes, new functionalities) or documentation, please go through the next steps (see: [Fork and Pull Request Workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr)):
1. Fork the repository to your own Github account
2. Clone the project to your machine
3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name
4. Commit changes to the branch
5. Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo
6. Push changes to your fork
7. Open a PR in our repository and follow the PR template so that we can efficiently review the changes.

Please consider the following rules when creating your PR (adapted from the [Auth0 Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/auth0/open-source-template/blob/master/GENERAL-CONTRIBUTING.md)):
* Only fix/add the functionality in question OR address wide-spread whitespace/style issues, not both.
* Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality (if a test suite already exists).
* Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
* Include documentation in the repo or on our docs site.
* Be accompanied by a complete Pull Request template (loaded automatically when a PR is created).
* For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes (e.g. a major release), it's best to open an Issue to discuss your proposal first. This is not required but can save time creating and reviewing changes.
