# Deployment Infrastructures

AccessBot has different Infrastructures depending on the Platform you want to use.

## Slack

When using Slack, AccessBot uses [Slack Socket Mode](https://api.slack.com/apis/connections/socket) to communicate with Slack, as you can see in the diagram below:

Because of that, AccessBot doesn't support Load Balancing. Our recommendation is to use a Container Orchestrator and use it with a single replica and a liveness probe (e.g. [k8s-descriptor.yaml](/k8s-descriptor.yaml)). 

In this scenario, for basic operations you don't need to configure any ingress rule.

## MS Teams

When using MS Teams, AccessBot needs to expose an endpoint on port 3141 that Azure is going to hit whenever there is a user request. After that, AccessBot uses the Teams API ([BotFramework API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/rest-api/bot-framework-rest-overview?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)) to send messages. This communication you can see in the diagram below:

## General Characteristics

Putting aside the platform you want to use, there are some points you need to pay attention to:

1. AccessBot has an endpoint on port 3141 that you can use for checking the health status: `http://localhost:3141/health-check`
2. AccessBot needs an ingress port on 3142 for monitoring metrics
