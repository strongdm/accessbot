* v1.0.x ([branch](https://github.com/strongdm/accessbot/tree/1.0.x)). Uses the old Slack API (RTM) - _requires a Slack Classic App_
* v1.1.x ([main](https://github.com/strongdm/accessbot)). Uses the new Slack API (Bolt)

For starting the bot enter all required variables in [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml) and execute:
```
./docker-start.sh
```

The bot would start running in the background. In order to check logs.
```
docker logs accessbot_accessbot_1
```

If you want to install and execute the bot locally, please refer to: [Configure Local Environment](docs/CONFIGURE_LOCAL_ENV.md)

## Getting Started
Once AccessBot is up and running, you can add it as an app or to a channel and start using it!

First, check the bot and Slack interconnectivity state:

You would expect to see no error in your logs and the messages **Yes I am alive** and plugin available.

If that's the case, enter any of the following commands:
* `help`. Show available commands 
* `show available resources`. Show available resources - all or the ones assigned to a role
* `access to resource-name`. Grant temporary access to a resource
* `show available roles`. Show all roles
* `access to resource-name`. Grant temporary access to all resources assigned to a role

For example:

## Optional access configuration

1. Set `SDM_AUTO_APPROVE_ALL=true` to disable approval entirely.
2. Use the strongDM CLI or SDK to add the following tags to individual resources:
      - `SDM_AUTO_APPROVE_TAG=auto-approve` -- automatic approval for this resource
      - `SDM_HIDE_RESOURCE_TAG=hide-resource` -- resource is not displayed via `show` command; any access request auto-fails

For more information, please refer to the [detailed guide for access configuration](docs/ACCESS_CONFIGURATION.md).
